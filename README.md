# Ontario Arrival Departure Dates
Calculating mass bird migration dates for all regions Ontario based on eBird data.

## Method
The methodology is based on [Mike Burrell's blog post](http://mikeburrell.blogspot.com/2012/04/guide-to-spring-arrival-dates-in.html).
The frequency data is analyzed to calculate the mass spring arrival date of each species for each region of Ontario. 
Charts and maps will be added to visualize some of the data.
In the future, fall migration will also be included.
