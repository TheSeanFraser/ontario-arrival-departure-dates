# Ontario Arrival & Departure Dates
Calculating mass bird migration dates for all regions of Ontario based on eBird data.

## Method
The methodology is based on [Mike Burrell's blog post](http://mikeburrell.blogspot.com/2012/04/guide-to-spring-arrival-dates-in.html).
The frequency data is analyzed to calculate the mass spring and fall arrival dates of each species for each region of Ontario. 
Charts and maps will be added to visualize some of the data.
